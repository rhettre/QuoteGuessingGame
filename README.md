#Quote Guessing Game

I wrote this file as part of Colt Steele's Modern Python 3 Bootcamp on Udemy

The program crawls quotes.toscrape.com and stores the quote, author and link to author bio using BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. 

A random quote is printed to the console and the user is given 4 chances to guess who the author of the quote is getting hints after each incorrect guess. 

Have Fun Playing :)
